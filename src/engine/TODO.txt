TODO:

* Add support for other types of rendering with buffers and HW TnL.

* Add more pixel formats to UnclippedBlt, for surfaces outside of Begin/EndScene pairs.
	- Finish ImageTransfer 24bit->32bit (to restore mdlc on the original artwork)




DONE:
* Fix clipping, intel issue.
* Fix lighting inconsistency.  fixed?
* Add software texture copy to UnclippedBlt, for surfaces outside of Begin/EndScene pairs.

* Some colour keying issues remain - such as the build sphere texture.
* The "Higher res", "lower resolution" buttons have no effect anymore (fixed)
* the little jumps are damn annoying, they are not lag related, but rendering problems it 
	seems. They are in timing with the lighting issues. Only when a base is in the system 
	it seems.
* 6-8 FPS in a furball (capships and lots of people shooting stuff) with 4*AA and 1920*1200 
	Not sure if it is meant to crawl like that, maybe my video card really is too slow (6600GT)
* You were forced to ecject by "yellow name" is not yellow but greenish
* caltrops have black squad behind it like the icons did - colour key.
* jumping of the rendered stuff. Move between flight and f3 view, you will notice little 
	jumps in and out of command view while switching.
* slight 'edge' effect on graphics in F3, i.e. there is a black ring around the He icon and aleph icons
* mini map sector and aleph lines are a bit light
* some text message colors are off (partially fixed. Need QA feedback).
* target box is also rather light (the box that is drawn around a ship when it is targeted, not the aiming reticule) this is especially noticeable when targeting an miner, you get a very pale gray box instead of a yellow box
* Stats panel in F4 is truncated.
* Tidy up code, remove old files. Still some more to do, work in progress.
* hud bar flicker (after a device reset? resolution or windowed>)
* Reenable mipmapping - not on environments.
* the high asteroids look tranparent and flicker. a new issue, as far as I can tell, at 
	least it is not in the R4 build.
* inbase screen has no hangar door, just a black rectangle - fixup RLE image playback.
* Game state image headers missing colour key - ARTWORK FIX REQUIRED.
* fix up texture > 2048 size problem for older hw (9700pro), use plain memory surface - TEST.
* Disable aa on 2d stuff/fonts to reduce fill rate.
* Lens flare. Colour key around "Exit Allegiance" message box. Must be related.
* Patch up VertexL type to match D3DLVERTEX CreateStaticMesh().
* Cache all device states, remove access to CD3DDevice9::Device().
* Fix up the transform screwup ingame.
* Switch to PURE HW device.
* VBIBManager resource deletion and tidy up.
* Texture manager resource deletion and tidy up.
* Device tidy up.
* Implement software color fill, for surfaces outside of Begin/EndScene pairs.
* Get to the bottom of the lighting - move light settings into the UpdateLighting()
	function.
* Remove legacy index code in CVBIBManager.
* Add dynamic vertex buffer support and integrate into the VertexGenerator.	Check that 
	everything is generating dynamic verts through the VertexGenerator.
* Add support for 16 bit font textures, if the device supports A1R5G5B5 textures.
* Add antialiasing to the startup menu. Enable startup menu resolution to work for menus?
* Add texture filtering type to the startup menu - bi/trilinear vs anisotropic.
* Enable mipmapping for 3D resources - limit textures to 512x512?
* Fix up the alt-f string to reflect device stats.
* Add performance monitoring to the CD3DDevice layer. Tex swaps, tris rendered, 
	number of DIP calls, etc.
* Check res and full/windowed switching.
* Check release build.
* Attach vertical blank flag.
* In base screen is not centered (at over 800:600), the active zones are in the right spot though. 
			(one has to click in the black screen to launch)
* minimizing the game from full screen makes impossible to bring it up again, but if you try, you
			still can click everything. (I autopiloted on F3 somehow).
* About the rescaling in flight: After enlarging the screen: When the mouse is in the middle of 
			the screen in Allegiance and I move it up to the window bar, it jumps to the right of 
			the window bar, it is not aligned with the rest.
* It crashes from time to time - **D**: probably just a lost device.
* windowed mode is $#@!ed, it does not rescale when increasing the window, it enlarged the screen.
* clicking in a bad area on the uncentered in base screen also crashes it.
* Allegiance is "always on top" in hardware rendering mode
* "device:" says TBD? What is that, it is not my video card. 
* switching from hardware to software rendering does *something*, hitting alt+ enter brought back 
			the screen. I was unable to return to hardware rendering - OPTION REMOVED AS NO LONGER RELEVANT.
* it does not remember the chosen settings at start-up
* brightness up and down dont have an effect - currently only work in full screen - need to look 
			into windowed mode, but probably won't be supported. (same as original behaviour on fx5600xt).
* Test non-pure and swvp versions.
* Flicker when going from f4 - causes a resize and goes to windowed when not necessary.



POSSIBLY FIXED, REQUIRE RETEST:
* with 964+694 resolution in 16 bits, in software, the screen is pink, not black, blueish also 
			possible when I increase the resolution. after blowing up because of sector boundary,
			my space is now red. resizing did not bring it back to black anymore. Running out of 
			oxygen, I returned to base and there resizing changed the screen colours again.
* the aiming reticule shows a black 2-2 cm window
* the mouse has a black square under the arrow in the minimap 
* thrust indicator and floating stuff also have a black square under it
* mouse has black squares under most command arrows, in flight and f3 view.
* I now have red arrows in the esc menu (with software rendering), but now it is not "always on top"
		 anymore?
