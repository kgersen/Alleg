- wintrek: move 3D settings dialog resource ('picker' resource) in engine
	doofus - don't move the dialog resource into the engine as this is app specific.

- lobby/client.cpp can't use PCH setting because of appweb
	what?  works fine for me with pre-compiled headers... 
	...the server uses PCH and appweb and you didn't have a problem with that?!
	
- fix mdlc (todo)
	-convert works again for engine supported formats only.
	- need 24bpp -> 32bpp support and CreateCompatibleSurface enhancments 
	(see also incomplete ImageTransfer functions) engine/TODO.txt
	
- move stuff in 'Test' directory to a more logical location then delete 'Test'
- remove unneeded libs in "linker/input/add. dep." setting of all projects
	See VS2010
	
- perform 2nd pass on cleaning .vcproj files
- perform cleaning on ..\standby
- refine all projects dependencies
	See VS2010
	
- DX9 'todo' : see src/engine/TODO.txt

- remove color codes from string entered by users (team names, game name, chat)
	I like colors, why remove this...says who?

(MAJOR - move tools over to Collada intermediate format for geometry?)


Alliances:

- change imbal behavior (1/2/NA/Auto)
	One method would be to force autobalance when alliances are on then have
	player counts based on ally group instead of side.
	
	Imbal is seriosuly bugged!  Consider reverting back to msoriginal and starting over.
	
- Game types other than conquest?
- "Nerf" options, if necessary:
	- Visibility toggle
	- Scan toggle
